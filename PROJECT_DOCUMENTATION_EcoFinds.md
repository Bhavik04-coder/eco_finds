## Project Title
**EcoFinds - Sustainable Second-Hand Marketplace**

## The Challenge
**EcoFinds â€“ Empowering Sustainable Consumption through a Second-Hand Marketplace**

## Overall Vision
The overarching vision for EcoFinds is to create a vibrant and trusted platform that revolutionizes the way people buy and sell pre-owned goods. It aims to foster a culture of sustainability by extending the lifecycle of products, reducing waste, and providing an accessible and convenient alternative to purchasing new items. EcoFinds envisions becoming the go-to destination for a conscious community seeking unique finds and responsible consumption.

## Mission
The mission for the hackathon team is to develop a user-friendly and engaging desktop and mobile application that serves as a central hub for buying and selling second-hand items. EcoFinds should leverage intuitive design and essential features to connect buyers and sellers efficiently, promoting a circular economy and making sustainable choices easier for everyone. This involves building a platform that is both functional and inspires trust and community.

## Problem Statement
Develop a foundational version of EcoFinds, focusing on core user authentication and product listing functionalities. Teams must deliver a functional prototype, accessible via both mobile and desktop interfaces, that allows users to register and log in, create and manage basic product listings (including title, description, category, price, and at least one image placeholder), and browse these listings with basic filtering and search capabilities. The system must employ efficient data structures for managing user and product data, ensuring a stable and responsive user experience.

### Core Requirements
- **User Authentication:** A simple and secure mechanism for user registration and login (e.g., email and password).
- **Profile Creation (Basic):** Ability for users to set a username.
- **User Dashboard:** Users should be able to edit all profile fields.
- **Product Listing Creation:** Create new product listings with title, description, predefined category, price, and at least one image placeholder.
- **Product Listing Management (CRUD - Basic):** Users can view, edit, and delete their own product listings.
- **Product Browsing:** Display a list of available product listings with basic info (title, price, placeholder image).
- **Category Filtering:** Filter listings by predefined categories.
- **Keyword Search:** Basic search on listing titles.
- **Product Detail View:** Show full details of a selected product (title, description, price, category, image).
- **Previous Purchase View:** Show products previously purchased by the user.
- **Cart:** Display all products added to the cart.
